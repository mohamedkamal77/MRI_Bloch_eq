> ​		**The FT of this Image is calculated using the function [np.fft.fft2()](), once we got the result, zero frequency component (DC component) will be at top left corner. We need to shift the result by N/2 in both the directions. This is simply done by the function, [np.fft.fftshift()](). (It is more easier to analyze).**
